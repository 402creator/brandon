# Basic Idea

Create a Broncos themed basic page to display their scores for the year.

## Theme

* Use black "Open Sans" font for standard text (and typography)
* Use Broncos orange and blue colors for other things on the page
* Add some Broncos images, etc

## Display the results of the games this season however you wish (table/list,etc)

* Show Match up and score for each team
* **Bonus Points**: Highlight scores in the table. Winning Broncos scores in green, losing in red
